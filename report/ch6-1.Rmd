# 6. TB research and innovation

_Draft! Prepared `r Sys.time()` _

One of the three pillars of the WHO End TB Strategy, adopted by all Member States in 2014, is TB research and innovation (`r ref_lnk("1, 2")`). The strategyâ€™s targets for reductions in TB disease burden set for 2035 (a 90% reduction in the TB incidence rate and a 95% reduction in the number of deaths caused by TB, compared with levels in 2015) can only be achieved with substantial technological breakthroughs, such as the availability and widespread use of a new TB vaccine (`r ref_lnk("3")`).

Since the adoption of the Strategy, Member States have reaffirmed and strengthened their commitments to TB research and innovation: in particular, through the Moscow Declaration to End TB in 2017 (`r ref_lnk("4")`), the Global Strategy for TB Research and Innovation in 2020 (`r ref_lnk("5")`) and political declarations from the United Nations (UN) high-level meetings on TB held in 2018 and 2023 (`r ref_lnk("6,7")`). These have all emphasized the need for strengthened TB research efforts and associated increases in investment. Top priorities include: the development of more accurate and affordable rapid point-of-care tests for diagnosing TB infection and disease and for detecting drug resistance; shorter, safer regimens for treating TB infection and TB disease, especially drug-resistant TB; a TB vaccine that is effective before and after exposure across a range of age groups; and strategies to optimally scale-up effective interventions.

WHO has promoted and monitored the development of new TB diagnostics, drugs, and vaccines, as well as operational research projects, for many years. Since 2023, this has been done through a <a href="https://tbtrialtrack.who.int/#/">TB trials tracker</a> (`r ref_lnk("8")`).

A summary of the latest status of progress is provided below. This covers funding for TB research; an overview of the clinical development pipelines for new TB diagnostics, drugs, treatment regimens and vaccines as of August 2024; and recent WHO initiatives to support the translation of research commitments that were made in the political declaration of the 2023 UN high-level meeting on TB.

## Funding for TB research

One of the main global targets in the political declaration of the 2023 UN high-level meeting on TB is that, by 2027, funding for TB research should reach US$ 5 billion annually. 

Despite a gradual increase in funding in recent years, the latest published data (`r ref_lnk("9")`) show that only US$ 1.0 billion was available in 2022, similar to the level of 2021 (`r lnk("Fig. 6.1")`) and falling far short of what is needed. Bridging the funding gap requires rapid translation of political commitment into country-level investments, including through innovative models of financing.

<hr />
<br />

The public sector accounts for the largest share of total funding for TB research. In 2022, it accounted for 66% of the total, followed by philanthropic organizations (19%), the private sector (11%) and multilateral agencies (4%).

The prominent role of public sector investments may help to ensure that when new health technologies become available for use, they are affordable and accessible. For example, in the European Union, draft legislation related to medicinal products for human use includes a provision stipulating that public financial support will be used to help maintain or improve affordable access (`r ref_lnk("10")`). In the United States of America, recent legislative proposals (`r ref_lnk("11, 12")`) seek to address the high cost of health products developed with the help of public funding. The latest draft of the WHO pandemic accord includes provisions to ensure that agreements related to government-funded research and development incorporate measures to promote timely and equitable access to new health products that result from such funding (`r ref_lnk("13")`).

## TB diagnostics

The diagnostic pipeline has continued to expand in terms of the number of diagnostic classes, tests, products and methods in development (`r lnk("Table 6.1")`). These include new biomarker-based point-of-care (POC) and near-POC test classes, as well as tests in existing diagnostic classes. Examples in existing classes include low and moderate complexity automated nucleic acid amplification diagnostic tests (NAATs) and targeted next-generation sequencing (NGS), as well as broth microdilution (BMD) technology. If BMD technology is approved by WHO, it will belong to the class of culture-based phenotypic tests. Additionally, the pipeline includes tools for testing for TB infection such as interferon-gamma release assays (IGRAs) and TB antigen-based skin tests, as well as computer-aided detection (CAD) using digital chest radiography to identify people with a high likelihood of having TB disease.

### <span style="color:#F21905">Table 6.1 </span>An overview of progress in the development of TB diagnostics, August 2024

<mark>TABLE 6.1 WILL BE INSERTED DIRECTLY IN SITEFINITY. SEE WORD DOC FOR TABLE</mark>

<br/>

In 2024, WHO convened a guideline development group to establish two new diagnostic classes: low-complexity, automated NAATs (LC-aNAATs) and low-complexity manual NAATs (LC-mNAATs). The use of concurrent tests for TB was also evaluated for three specific population groups: adults and adolescents living with HIV; children living with HIV; and children who are HIV-negative or HIV status unknown. 

Once available, WHO will review new evidence related to point-of-care tests (e.g. next-generation lateral flow lipoarabinomannan (LF-LAM) assays), near point-of-care molecular tests, BMD methods for drug susceptibility testing, new targeted NGS solutions, new IGRAs to test for TB infection and new CAD solutions to screen for TB.

## Treatment for TB disease (individual drugs and regimens)

As of August 2024, the TB trials tracker indicates that there were 29 drugs for the treatment of TB disease in Phase I, Phase II or Phase III trials, an increase from 28 in 2023 and eight in 2015. This growth demonstrates acceleration in the pace of TB drug development, following increased investment from multiple funders and efforts from several platforms and consortia. It also signals that more effective and diverse therapeutic options may soon become available to improve TB care and management. 

The 29 drugs comprise:


<ul>
<li>	18 new chemical entities (`r lnk("Table 6.2")`). These are alpibectir (BVL-GSK098), BTZ-043, delpazolid, GSK-286, ganfeborole (GSK-3036656), macozinone, MK-7762 (TBD09), quabodepistat (OPC-167832), TBAJ-587, TBAJ-876, TBI-223, pyrifazimine (TBI-166), TBA-7371, telacebec (Q203), sanfetrinem, SQ109, sutezolid and sudapyridine (WX-081);</li>   
<li>	Two drugs that received accelerated regulatory approval. These are bedaquiline and delamanid. Their efficacy as part of various treatment regimens for drug-resistant TB is currently being tested in several clinical trials, with the aim of optimizing their use and potentially expanding treatment options;</li>
<li>	One drug that was approved by the United States (US) Food and Drug Administration under the limited population pathway for antibacterial and antifungal drugs. This is pretomanid, which is part of the 6-month regimen for MDR/RR-TB and pre-XDR-TB recommended by WHO since 2022 (`r ref_lnk("14")`). Its safety and efficacy in the treatment of drug-resistant TB continue to be tested in trials, especially in combination with bedaquiline and linezolid;</li>
<li>Eight repurposed drugs. These are clofazimine, levofloxacin, linezolid, moxifloxacin, rifampicin (high dose), rifapentine, sitafloxacin and tedizolid.</li>
</ul>

Various combination regimens with new or repurposed drugs, as well as host-directed therapies, are also in Phase II or Phase III/IV trials or being evaluated as part of operational research projects.

## TB preventive treatment

As of August 2024, there were at least 30 clinical trials and implementation research studies to evaluate drug regimens and models of delivery for TB preventive treatment (`r lnk("Table 6.3")`). Examples included a trial for the prevention of MDR-TB using delamanid, studies to assess how to optimize treatment administration in very young children and people living with HIV, new models of delivery of TB preventive treatment, trials of thrice-weekly isoniazid and rifapentine for one month and trials of rifamycin monotherapies for durations of 6 or 8 weeks.

## TB vaccines

As of August 2024, there were 15 vaccine candidates in clinical development: four in Phase I, five in Phase II and six in Phase III (`r lnk("Table 6.4")`), down from 16 in 2023. The pipeline includes candidates to prevent TB infection and TB disease, and candidates to help improve the outcomes of treatment for TB disease. A renewed and coordinated commitment to basic discovery research, preclinical studies and clinical trials remains essential to expand the number of candidates in the pipeline.
